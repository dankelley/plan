\usage{
read.burndown(file, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a connection or a character string giving the name of the file
to load.}

\item{debug}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} to print debugging information.}
}
\value{
A burndown object.
}
\description{
Read a data file containing burndown information.
}
\details{
Reads a \code{burndown} dataset.

A strict format is required, in which the following items must be present,
in the stated order, and with nothing else in the file.  An example is given
after the description.

\itemize{

\item Line 1: contains two comma-separated items: the string \code{Start},
and a time expressed in ISO 8601 format (\code{YYYY-MM-DD} or
\code{YYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss}).  This line indicates the start of the project.

\item Line 2: as Line 1, but the string is to be \code{Start}, and the line
indicates the deadline for the project.

\item Line 3: a header line for a "tasks" list, comprising the following
three words separated by commas: \code{Key}, \code{Description}, and
\code{Effort}.

\item Lines 4 to N: data lines, each containing three items: a numeric index
"Key" for the task, a short "Description" of the task, and the estimated
"Effort" for this task, expressed as a number. The keys must be distinct,
and they must match the keys in the progress table (see below).  The
description should be short enough to give a reasonable-size legend as
created by \code{\link{plot,burndown-method}}.  The effort may be expressed in any
convenient unit, e.g. the number of hours or days for the task, or as a
percentage of the overall task.

\item Line N+1: a header line for the "Progress" list, comprising the
following four words separated by commas: \code{Key}, \code{Done}, and
\code{Time}.

\item Line N+2 to end: data lines holding Progress items. Each "Key" must
match a key in the task list.  The "Done" column holds the percentage of the
task that has been completed. The "Time" is in ISO 8601 format, as described
above.  }
